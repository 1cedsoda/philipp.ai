Great. I’ll put together a comprehensive strategy to build your AI engineering agent. This will cover:

* A modular, model-agnostic agent framework using LangGraph, LangChain, and Graphiti
* A self-hostable runtime with access to a terminal, browser, GUI apps (like KiCad), and N8N workflows, capable of running both in a VM and optionally on a laptop
* An extensible chat frontend with Typescript/React, supporting file uploads, code blocks, persistent multi-session chat, and remote CLI/MCP control
* A plan for integrating model selection, long-term memory with Git + Graphiti, recursive task solving, and system self-extension
  I’ll gather real examples, repos, architecture patterns, and tools people have used to build similar systems. I’ll also outline a staged roadmap to bootstrap the first working version and evolve toward your full vision.

I’ll get back to you shortly with the strategy and resources.


# Architecture and Core Components

The system centers on an **agent framework** built with LangChain/LangGraph (in Python) and a **knowledge graph memory** (Graphiti/Zep) on the backend, plus a modern TypeScript/React chat UI.  Graphiti (by Zep AI) provides a real-time, temporally-aware knowledge graph that continuously ingests and links user interactions, files, and external data into a unified memory.  This graph memory serves as the agent’s **short-term and factual context**, enabling incremental updates and fast, indexed retrieval without repeated LLM calls.  We also add a **long-term memory layer** (e.g. Letta/MemGPT or Mem0) for persistent facts and multi-session recall.  Letta (formerly MemGPT) is an open-source agent framework that implements a dual-layer memory (RAM-like working memory plus a disk-backed archival memory) so that agents “live forever” by retaining and indexing history across sessions.  In practice, we can run Graphiti with a Neo4j backend and also plug in a database-backed memory (Letta, Mem0, or Zep’s off-the-shelf SDK) to capture long-term “lessons learned” and user preferences.  In summary, the architecture is multi-layered: a **LangChain/LangGraph** agent orchestrates tasks and tools, **Graphiti/Zep** provides dynamic knowledge-graph memory, and **Letta/Mem0** (or similar) provides archival memory for facts and documents.

# Tools and Environment Access

The agent is given a suite of tools to interact with the environment.  Critically, we expose a **shell/terminal tool** so the LLM can run OS commands, install languages, run Docker, etc.  LangChain’s ShellTool (or equivalent) lets the agent execute arbitrary bash commands on the host, e.g. `curl`, `docker run`, `pip install`, `make`, or launching GUI apps (via command-line).  This grants it an “engineering playground” in its own Linux VM.  As LangChain docs note, “the LLM can use it to execute any shell commands… letting the LLM interact with your local file system”.  We also integrate other tools: a web browser/search tool for retrieving internet data, a file-system browser, and an email client (e.g. Gmail via API or n8n’s Gmail node) so the agent can “read important news from my mails” and web pages.  For designing ASICs, we can script KiCad or other EDA tools (KiCad has a Python API and CLI commands) so the agent can, for example, call `kicad-cli footprint import`, run `sch2pcb`, simulate, etc.  In sum, the agent combines **LLM reasoning** with concrete tools: a Terminal/Shell tool, web scraping/search tools, file I/O tools, and any domain-specific tools (e.g. KiCad script).  Using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** standard, we wrap many of these as “MCP servers” so Claude (or any MCP-compatible LLM) can invoke them directly.  For instance, Graphiti itself provides an MCP server that exposes episode and entity-management endpoints. This MCP approach lets the agent call external services or OS commands as “tool functions” with clear JSON schemas and automatic STDIO interfacing.  (Anthropic’s guidance explicitly recommends using STDIO transport for local MCP servers, for simplicity and debugging.)

# Memory Management (Short-Term vs Long-Term)

The agent maintains **multi-layer memory**.  The **knowledge graph (Graphiti)** captures ongoing dialogue and dynamic context: it absorbs each conversation turn, created entities (people, projects, design components), file contents, and tool outputs into a Neo4j graph.  Graphiti’s bi-temporal model even timestamps when data was created vs ingested, so it can resolve conflicts and answer “what was known at time T”.  This graph-backed memory is ideal for short-to-mid-term reasoning and retrieval.  For longer-term memory, we layer in a persistent store (like Letta or mem0) that snapshots key facts (e.g. “user favorite programming languages”, “ongoing projects”) and even full conversation logs.  Letta’s framework explicitly “manages state using a dual-layer memory system: core (RAM-like) and archival (disk-like) long-term”, so one can integrate that with Graphiti.  Zep AI’s memory offering also uses Graphiti for short-term and stores distilled long-term memory objects separately.  In practice, we would use Graphiti (backed by Neo4j) as our working memory, and periodically commit important updates or snapshots to a git-backed repository (text notes, code revisions, etc.) for maximum persistence and auditability.

# Agent Framework and Model Selection

We build the agent using **LangChain (Chains/Agents)** and/or **LangGraph**. LangChain gives us reusable tools and agent wrappers, while LangGraph (a LangChain-based framework) adds **stateful graph workflows**.  LangGraph lets us define workflows as graphs of nodes (sub-agents or functions) and edges, with built-in persistence and branching.  This supports recursive, multi-step tasks (e.g. *decompose “design ASIC” into sub-tasks*).  LangGraph supports human-in-the-loop and recovery from errors. We would choose either approach depending on complexity: simple tasks can use LangChain agents with our custom tools, whereas complex projects use a LangGraph graph workflow.  For example, LangGraph has a ReAct-style agent node that calls tools (e.g. our ShellTool, BrowserTool) and then continues based on the output.

The agent is **model-agnostic**: it primarily uses a powerful base model (e.g. Claude 4 or GPT-4o) for planning and coding, but it can switch to specialty models when needed. We build a model-selection layer: for coding tasks or math we might call Codex/GPT-4o, for image generation a vision model (OpenAI’s GPT-4 Vision or Stable Diffusion), and for quick chat maybe a smaller local LLaMA variant. Tools like Vercel AI SDK or LangGraph’s LLM provider interface can route requests to different models.  The UI and backend libraries (e.g. assistant-ui/AI SDK) support plugging in providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, local GPU models (Ollama, Llama.cpp). We ensure keys or local runtimes for each. As tasks arise (e.g. “design circuit”), the agent introspects on computational needs and picks an optimal model.

# Frontend Chat Interface

For the UI, we use an open-source React/TypeScript chat framework so we don’t reinvent the wheel.  For example, **assistant-ui** is a popular TS/React library that mimics ChatGPT’s interface and supports code blocks, Markdown, syntax highlighting, file attachments, images, streaming, and custom components.  It offers primitives (not monolithic) so it’s easy to extend with our own design and tools. Alternatively, LobeChat or LibreChat are full applications that support multiple AI providers, file upload/RAG, and plugin markets.  In our case, we might start with assistant-ui’s starter template (or a Next.js boilerplate) to get a chat UI up quickly. It already handles code formatting and file upload. We’d integrate it with our backend via websockets or HTTP (the UI can send user messages and receive streamed LLM responses).  Since we prefer minimal frontend dev, using a library or template ensures we have a TS/React codebase ready, with theming and mobile responsiveness out of the box.  The UI will also let the agent display images (for ASIC diagrams, outputs, etc.) and download/upload files (e.g. design docs, code patches). In short, existing solutions like assistant-ui (TS/React) provide exactly the features (chat, code, file upload) we need.

# Persistence, State and Debugging

Each chat session corresponds to an agent instance with its own memory. We persist conversation history and memory across sessions by writing them to the knowledge graph and a git repo. For example, every few turns the agent can `commit` updated project files and logs to a private Git repo, giving versioned long-term storage. The Graphiti memory (Neo4j) holds structured context. We also maintain user preferences or facts in a JSON or database store. To handle **multiple simultaneous chats**, we namespace memory by session ID. The agent state (LangGraph workflow state) is stored so it can resume where it left off if interrupted. For debugging, we rely on extensive logging. LangChain/LangGraph can log each tool call and reasoning step; we print those to console or a log file. We avoid paid services like LangSmith by building our own lightweight tracing: every agent query and response is recorded (and can be viewed via the React UI or by inspecting the memory graph). Graphiti’s GUI or the LangGraph state visualizer can show the decision steps. In practice, we run in a VM/container that the developer can inspect. We also follow Claude’s advice: implement robust error handling in each MCP/tool call and include logging/debug messages. This way, we can replay and debug agent actions from logs and persisted state.

# Workflow Orchestration and Scheduling

For background tasks and scheduling, we integrate **n8n** (an open-source workflow automation tool). n8n can invoke our agent (via an API or CLI) on a schedule or trigger. For example, an n8n workflow can fetch unread emails (using its Gmail node), and then call the agent to “summarize important news from these emails.” Another workflow might trigger daily “clean-up tasks” or long-running jobs. n8n easily connects to 400+ apps and also has LLM/AI nodes built-in. We use n8n webhooks or built-in nodes to let the agent “re-trigger itself”: the agent could enqueue a future task (e.g. “remind me tomorrow to review chip design”) and n8n will run the agent with that prompt at the right time. In essence, n8n acts as the scheduler/cron for the agent’s autonomous routines. Anthropic even highlights use cases like automating workflow creation with LLMs in such tools. By combining n8n and MCP, the agent can also install new MCP plugins (like an n8n workflow or a DXT extension) by generating code and having n8n execute it. In summary, **n8n** provides the glue: scheduled tasks, cross-service triggers, and long-running pipelines that the agent can tap into.

# Step-by-Step Development Plan

1. **Environment Setup**: Provision a Linux VM (or cloud VPS). Install Docker and essential tools (Python 3, Node/TS, Neo4j). Clone or initialize repositories for the backend and frontend. Set up Python virtualenv/poetry. Choose base LLM providers (e.g. sign up for OpenAI/Anthropic keys).

2. **Memory Layer**: Install Neo4j (via Docker) and Graphiti. Test ingesting simple text into Graphiti (e.g. `graphiti text --data "Hello world" --source chat`). Verify you can query the graph. Optionally install Zep or Letta for long-term memory. Connect Letta with a Postgres DB or use Mem0’s library to start indexing any user data.

3. **Agent Core (LangChain/LangGraph)**: Write a prototype agent. Start with LangChain’s REACT agent using our ShellTool. For example, test that the agent can fetch a README with `curl` and analyze it. Integrate Graphiti’s MCP: run the Graphiti MCP server (it’s provided in the Graphiti repo) and register it as a tool. The agent should then be able to ask the graph (e.g. via `add_memory`, `query_memory`).

4. **Model Plugins**: Integrate multiple LLM endpoints. Configure Anthropic API as default and test a conversation. Add local model capability (e.g. install `llama.cpp` or `ollama`) and wrap it as a HuggingFace endpoint or CLI that LangChain can call. In the agent code, implement logic to choose models based on task (this can start simple, e.g. hard-code preferences, then refine with AI help).

5. **Frontend Chat UI**: Initialize the chat UI project (e.g. `npx assistant-ui create`). Customize it to call your backend API for streaming chat. Ensure it supports code blocks, file upload and display, and images. Test uploading a file in the UI and having the agent read it.

6. **Tool Development**: Build any special tools needed: e.g. write an MCP server (DXT) in TypeScript or Python for tasks like file search or email reading. Use Claude Desktop’s DXT tooling if targeting Claude (they provide templates). Write a script that uses the Gmail API to pull recent emails and register it as an MCP tool or an n8n node.

7. **n8n Workflows**: Set up an n8n instance (can also run on the same VM). Create example flows: “New Mail → Call Agent to summarize” and “Every morning at 8 AM → Task the agent”. Test these by having n8n send prompts to the agent API and checking results.

8. **Iteration with AI**: Use a stronger LLM (e.g. GPT-4) as a coding assistant to write boilerplate for agent logic, Graphiti schemas, or MCP manifests. For example, prompt ChatGPT or Claude with “Generate a LangChain tool definition for a Linux file search using ls/grep.”  Incorporate its output into your code and test. The agent can also use its own capabilities: for bootstrapping, you can implement a task where the agent reads its codebase and suggests improvements, or even writes a new plugin (with careful review).

9. **Testing and Debugging**: As you add features, test end-to-end. Check that multiple chats don’t bleed memory. Use logging: have the agent print each step and tool call (LangChain’s verbose mode, Graphiti logs, n8n execution logs). Fix issues. Anthropic’s guidance on DXT emphasizes robust validation of tool calls—we follow that by checking JSON schemas and timeouts.

10. **Scale to Multiple Sessions**: Once one agent is stable, spin up session support. Each new “chat” creates a new memory graph or namespace. Use the graph ID to separate memory. Implement a simple session manager in the backend (or leverage LangGraph’s state persistence) so you can pause and resume any chat.

# Integration of AI in the Build Process

Throughout development, we use LLMs as co-developers.  Write documentation and plan architecture with a GPT-4 system prompt (e.g. “Outline code for integrating Graphiti into LangChain”). For coding, use Claude Code or OpenAI Chat with system prompts to generate scaffolding: e.g. ask for TypeScript skeleton of a Claude DXT manifest for file operations. Always review and test AI-generated code. Over time, the agent itself becomes more autonomous: for instance, after some core features exist, we could give it the prompt “Add a new feature: let the assistant set calendar reminders” and see if it can modify the workflow or write new MCP definitions (again, with human oversight). This **bootstrapping** approach – using the AI to help write its own tools – speeds development.
